# Data Management

This repository showcases a comprehensive exploration of data transformation from a relational database to a graph database using SQL and Neo4j. The project is divided into distinct phases, each demonstrating a crucial step in the process.

## Key Features

### Data Querying with SQL:

- Utilized SQL to query data from a relational database, extracting valuable insights using `SELECT` statements, `JOIN` operations, and `WHERE` clauses.
- Examined the power of relational databases for structured data storage and retrieval.

### Graph Database Migration with Neo4j:

- Implemented data migration from the relational database to Neo4j, a popular graph database.
- Transformed the relational data model into a graph-based structure to leverage relationships between entities.

### Cypher Queries for Graph Data Retrieval:

- Introduced Cypher, the query language for Neo4j, to retrieve data based on graph patterns and relationships.
- Demonstrated the flexibility of graph databases in representing and querying complex, interconnected data.
