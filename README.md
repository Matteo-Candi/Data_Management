# Data Management

This repository showcases a comprehensive exploration of data transformation from a relational database to a graph database using SQL and Neo4j. As data complexity grows, the ability to efficiently model, query, and manage relationships between entities becomes increasingly important. Relational databases have long been a staple for structured data storage, but they are sometimes limited in representing the complex, interconnected nature of certain datasets. Graph databases, like Neo4j, offer a more intuitive way to model and query these relationships, making them an attractive solution for modern data management needs.

In this project, we explore the entire pipeline, starting with querying and managing data within a traditional relational database using SQL. From there, the data is migrated to a graph database, where it is transformed into a more flexible graph structure. This allows us to leverage the powerful querying capabilities of Neo4jâ€™s Cypher language to better capture the connections and patterns within the data. This repository is a practical demonstration of how to blend relational and graph database technologies to achieve efficient data management, enabling more effective data-driven decision-making and analysis.

## Key Features

### Data Querying with SQL:

- Utilized SQL to query data from a relational database, extracting valuable insights.
- Examined the power of relational databases for structured data storage and retrieval.

### Graph Database Migration with Neo4j:

- Implemented data migration from the relational database to Neo4j, a popular graph database.
- Transformed the relational data model into a graph-based structure to leverage relationships between entities.

### Cypher Queries for Graph Data Retrieval:

- Introduced Cypher, the query language for Neo4j, to retrieve data based on graph patterns and relationships.
- Demonstrated the flexibility of graph databases in representing and querying complex, interconnected data.
